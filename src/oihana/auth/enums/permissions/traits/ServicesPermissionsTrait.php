 * Permission subjects scoped to the `/services` resource.

 * class stays flat while source files remain resource-focused. Each constant
 * value must match a `subject` declared in `api/configs/auth-seed.toml` — this
 * invariant is enforced by the permission consistency tests.
 *
 * The `*_LIST` subjects below double as field-level gates for the `?skin=full`
 * projection on `GET /services` and `GET /services/{id}`. They are declared
 * on the `AQL::FIELDS` entries via `Field::REQUIRES`, so a caller lacking
 * the permission receives the service document with the corresponding edge
 * stripped (the `*Count` companion field stays visible regardless, unless
 * explicitly gated).
